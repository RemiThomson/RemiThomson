## :smiley: About Me

I‚Äôm curious about how software and hardware work together, whether that‚Äôs the structure of a digital system or how things can be made to run more efficiently. That curiosity has led me to explore both aspects of my degree: I‚Äôve worked on personal projects ranging from building websites and writing code to hands-on projects with physical hardware. I enjoy figuring out how to make systems work better, especially when there‚Äôs a mix of design and performance involved.

This summer, I‚Äôll be joining the Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA) at the University of Edinburgh for a research internship focused on hardware optimisation. I‚Äôll be working on the Gemmini deep learning accelerator platform - an open-source systolic array designed to run AI workloads efficiently on RISC-V systems. My focus will be on analysing and improving system-level performance: exploring how architectural changes and hardware-software co-design can better support AI inference tasks.
